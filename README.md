# Class Roster

This is a basic application created for my Scripting and Programming Class. 
This program maintains a current roster of students and will be used to help migrate an existing student system to a new platform.

## Summary

The program contains five classes (Student , SecurityStudent , NetworkStudent , SoftwareStudent , and  Roster) and maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree. The program reads a list of five students and uses function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program creates student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program. The entire student list is stored in one array of students called 'classRosterArray', Specific data-related output is directed to the console.
